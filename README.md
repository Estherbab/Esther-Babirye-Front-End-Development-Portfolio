## Introduction
My name is Esther Babirye and I am currently an edx skills bootcamp student learning front-end web development.

This portfolio is a look into work i have created using flexbox, CSS grid, media queries and CSS variables.

I have built a live web application to showcase the skills and talents I have learnt and implemented so far.
